Here comes figures you created. It is advised to use the `990_shared_figures` folder to save figures ready for the manuscript,
as this folder is meant to be shared as a submodule.
It will allow links from manuscript to figures to still work when using a different folder organization based of manuscript edition.

## Content

This folder will contain all figures created during the research process. It is advised to use vector figures (adobe illustrator,
or .pdf, .svg files) when possible, as their size does not change with higher quality outputs.

## Organization

Similarly to the analysis folder, The content may be organized following the different
experiments, or by different figures created or a mix of
these two. In addition we have one folder already present in
the template:

{{% expand "990_shared_figures" %}}
This folder shall contain figures that are ready for dissemination.
This folder is usually shared with other lab members, in order to obtain feedback.

It is good practice to link only to figures saved in that folder when writing dissemination material, especially when writing manuscripts.
