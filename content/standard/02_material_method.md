This folder may link to external resources, or be a common folder/repository shared with the whole lab.

It is important to name methods following a version control mechanism, so one is sure to link data to the right material or method
{{% / notice %}}

## Content

This folder will contain information needed to reproduce experiments,
information that would eventually end up in the material and method section of a paper.

It is good practice to keep the information up to date and to enter information as soon as possible.
For instance, reagents shall be best documented at the time of purchase.

One can use RRID numbers for reagents, and doi for protocols as unique identifiers.

## Organization

One may use a key reagent table (a spreadsheet) to collect information about reagents.

Protocols may be best entered as text files, or one can use tools like protocols.io to share and version control the protocols,
and only add links in a readme here.
