{{% notice info%}}
This folder is usually only shared with close collaborators and is specific to one project.
An exception could be the data management plan that can link to external resources.

Be sure not to include personal data if you are sharing (or planning to share) the whole project openly.

## Content

This folder will contain mostly text documents related to the management of the project,
like correspondence with university, funding agency and co-workers, minutes of meetings and ethical permits.
In addition, we put data managements plans and paper notebook in this folder.

## Organization

{{% expand "01_administration_files" %}}
Any administrative material coming from the university of the funding agency shall come here.

For example, one may save public contact information, quotes and bills, or official letters in this folder

{{% expand "02_accepted grants" %}}
Sometimes a project should follow the plan written in a grant, it is good to save the accepted grant here,
so one always have it at hand.

{{% expand "03_meeting_minutes" %}}
That often becomes a very important folder. A good practice is to start a minute file before the meeting,
which includes the goals and agenda of the meeting.

Alternatively to one file per meeting, one can have rolling minutes files,
where minutes of different meetings (with the same people) are following each other in one file.

{{% expand "04 related literature" %}}
Pdf of important papers may come here. Our advice is to save notes related to the read papers,
but save the pdf in a common place for the whole lab to save data storage space.

{{% expand "05 data management plans" %}}
The data management plans will (under other tasks) explain how you will organize and name your dataset files,
what standards you will use, and where the data will be published.
It is important to make it available and easy to access,
in order to facilitate the implementation of the plan during the research process.

There are different tools and templates available, like DMPonline or the RDMO tool.

{{% expand "06_notebook" %}}
Save digital notebook information here.
It could be photos of a paper notebook, self-organized text files, data exported from an electronic lab notebook (ELN).
If you are using an ELN, you may better have a link in the project main readme file.
