{{% notice info%}}
This folder is usually not shared in its entirety, but specific subfolder are usually shared independently.

One may want to keep all dissemination material in one place, independently of the project they belong to.
To this end, you may want to use links,
folder aliases or cloud technologies to reorganize the same content at different places.
{{% / notice %}}

## Content

This folder contains files meant for scholarly communication and reports. It ranges from a presentation for a lab report,
to a conference poster or a manuscript.

## Organization

This folder is separated between different dissemination types, with reports and conference material on one side,
and manuscript on the other side.
This was done because manuscripts are a particular research outputs that often requires a special sharing strategy.

{{% notice warning%}}
File naming convention and the version control system is particularly important in this folder.
{{% / notice %}}

{{% expand "01_report_conf" %}}
This folder will contain dissemination material used for reports (for instance lab reports),
and conferences (typically posters or presentations).

These documents are typically ordered by time (you may want to look mostly at the latest document created),
and type (poster, presentation or text document).
This is probably best described by naming files or folders here with:

- date in `yyyymmdd` format
- type of document: `presentation`,`poster`,`textdoc`
- conference name or acronym
- 2 digit version number (if not using an automatic version control system)

It is up to you to use folders (for instance to save the abstract and the presentation to a conference at the same place),
or simply have files listed in the repository.

{{% expand "02:manuscript" %}}
Here will come the manuscripts for your project.
This may be a link to a document written on a collaborative working platform (Overleaf, Google Docs, Fidus Writer, PubPub, â€¦)
or a document (markdown,latex, docx).

You are advised to link or save the data coming from your reference manager
(For zotero, it could be the bibtex export) in the same folder,
and explain in a readme file how people should collaborate in the edition of the manuscript.

Important versions of the manuscript should be saved and name with particular care, as you may have specific rights over them:

- the version submitted to the journal
- the version accepted by the journal (after peer review, before proof reading)

In addition, it is wise to expect that your manuscript may be rejected,
and that you will need to adapt it to a different journal in the future.
It is wise to keep the reference linked to the reference manager at least until submission.
