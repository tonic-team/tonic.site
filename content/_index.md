# Welcome to Tonic

In the course of many research projects, digital data of various kinds is used and created.
This data is often organized in implicitly grown file structures, so new collaborators or staff must understand the file structure before they can explore the content.
If research projects could adhere to a common file structure standard, data sharing and collaboration were more efficient.
The Tonic project aims to develop a common file structure for neuroscientific research projects.
Supporting project templates and tooling for project structure creation and validation will also be implemented.
All of them will be documented on this site.
Tonic has been initiated to augment the [GIN] (G-Node infrastructure), a version control system for neuroscientific data, but isn't restricted to GIN.
